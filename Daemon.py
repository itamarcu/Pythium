class D√¶mon:
    """D√¶mons are cybernatural ghosts that infest our plane.

    Saprotrophic research has yielded the following properties of d√¶mons:
    * Each d√¶mon has a special waveform, or frequency, known more commonly as
      its "true name". The true names of d√¶mons are unique - there can only be
      one in each cyberspace.
    * Knowledge of the true name of a d√¶mon gives others the ability to interact
      with it, communicating telepathically and instantly, as long as they are
      within the same cyberspace.
    * D√¶mons spend their time slumbering, simply waiting and listening in their
      mind. The moment they sense somebody speak their true name, they listen
      and then obey their imperatives. Only when they finish fully obeying do
      they return to their slumbering state and await further directions.
    * The true name of a d√¶mon must follow the cultural traditions of d√¶monkind.
    * Some d√¶mons are given temporary nicknames by their summoners.
