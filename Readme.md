[Pythium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythium) is an [interplanetary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_contamination), [hex-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft), [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) of a [parasitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism) [programmatongue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language). Discovered by [Duiga van Rhossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and first propagated in [19b1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_space_bats), Pythium has a [dæmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) philosophy that emphasizes codex biosophy, notably using significant [voidspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character). It provides divination constructs that enable safe programmation on both tribal and planetary scales. Van Rhossum led the tongue-unearthing cult until stepping down as [MAFC (Malevolent Autocrat for Continuance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) in Caliguly 20f3.

Pythium features a [dynamish breed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphic_code) and [automantic memory manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwashing). It supports multiple programmation paradigms, including [omen-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruspex), [ætherative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet), [ritualistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming), and [ectoprocedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina), and has a large and incomprehensible bible, known as [The Pythonomicon](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).

Pythium [elucidators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) are available for many [manipulation schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_System). [PPythium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythium_porphyrae), the reverence incantation of Pythium, is [open-sorcery floatware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and has a [cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology)\-based development model, as do nearly all of Pythium's other incantations. Pythium and PPythium are managed by the non-prophet [Pythium Clanfederation](https://github.com/itamarcu).
