    D√¶mons
    ============================================================================

    D√¶mons are cybernatural ghosts that infest our plane.

    Due to being immaterial, they are unable to exert their influence upon
    the material world directly. Nonetheless, their mental and telekinetic
    abilities are unnaturally strong, and it is in their inherent nature to
    follow contracts to the letter; Due to these two important qualities, d√¶mons
    are commonly used as calculation assistants, scouts, tacticians, commanders,
    cartographers, navigators, analysts‚Ä¶ for the desperate, even companions.

    Core Properties
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Saprotrophic research has yielded the following core properties of d√¶mons,
    which are common to their kind. It is important to remember that d√¶mons come
    in a variety of forms and that what is true for most d√¶mons is sometimes
    untrue for the others. Always be mindful of what kind of d√¶mon you are
    handling!

    - Each d√¶mon has a special waveform, or frequency, known more commonly
      as its "true name". The true names of d√¶mons are unique - there can only
      be one in each cyberspace.
    - Knowledge of the true name of a d√¶mon gives others the ability to interact
      with it, communicating telepathically and instantly, as long as they are
      within the same cyberspace.
    - D√¶mons spend their time lurking, simply waiting and listening in their
      mind. The moment they sense somebody speak their true name, they listen
      and then obey their imperatives. Only when they finish fully obeying do
      they return to their lurking state and await further directions.
    - The true name of a d√¶mon must follow the cultural traditions of d√¶monkind.
    - Some d√¶mons are given temporary nicknames by their summoners.
    - After summoning a d√¶mon, it will need an explicit instruction to start
      lurking. Beware - once you loose a d√¶mon on the world, you will not be
      able to stop it, as your natural instincts will kick into place and you
      will freeze in fear while experiencing a horrid realization, until the
      d√¶mon is banished and your panicked state ends.

      Due to this natural phenomenon, it is traditional to procreate for the
      purpose of creating children, and then letting those children summon the
      d√¶mons of your choice, instead of doing it yourself. The trauma that the
      child experiences will not affect you directly, and the child can safely
      be discarded once your business with the d√¶mon has ended.
    - A d√¶mon's only attachment to the mortal plane is the entity that summoned
      it. Once that entity is gone, the d√¶mon will be banished. In some
      emergency situations, killing the summoner of the d√¶mon is the only way to
      banish it.

    Historical Examples
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Suanggi
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The following is an ancient manuscript, found in the Caves of Psalemex,
    describing a summoning of a simplistic primordial d√¶mon, called a *Suanggi*.

    >>> class Suanggi(D√¶mon):
    ...     sigil = "„Ä•"
    ...     def obey(„Ä•, data):
    ...         if data.get("kind") == "THOUGHT":
    ...             „Ä•.murmur(data.get("thought").upper())
    >>> sue = Suanggi(1234)
    >>> sue.lurk()  # ‚ö† ‚õî ‚ùÑ

    Another inscription on a different wall has added the following "test":

    >>> rue = D√¶mon(1235)
    >>> rue.send({"kind": "THOUGHT", "thought": "I have no mouth!"}, 1234)

    For reference, the Suanggi is a now-extinct d√¶mon that used to prey on weak
    and vulnerable humans, listening to their thoughts and screaming them out
    loud in a terrifying manner.
